// Tasks to be done:

• I will ask the user for their height.
• If the height is below 1 or above 8 (or not an integer), repeatedly ask the user until valid input is provided.
• Iterate from a number to the user's specified height: during each iteration (i), print (i) hash symbols followed by a new line.
